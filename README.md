The World Happiness Report Data Analysis Project aims to examine and analyze global happiness trends based on the data provided in the World Happiness Report. The project involves exploring key factors influencing happiness levels across countries, identifying patterns and correlations, and gaining insights into the impact of various socio-economic and cultural variables on overall well-being. Through statistical analysis and visualization techniques, the project seeks to highlight the countries with the highest and lowest happiness scores, uncover significant contributing factors, and potentially propose recommendations for policy improvements to enhance global happiness. The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of global happiness and contribute valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the public.
